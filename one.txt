pwd 
(print working directory)

git add .
(statement to add files)

git commit -m "message"
(into the staging area)

git log
(history of the repository)

git diff <id-1> <id-2>
(shows difference between two git files)

git checkout <id>
    (switches to the specific snapshot of the git)
    -> now if you checkout in an earlier branch. You should make a new branch
    for the changes that are going to be made. 
    and then can merge from the main branch to have those changes.

three stages are as follows:-

working directory -> staging directory  -> .git directory
(local modify)    -> (commit to local)  -> (push)
